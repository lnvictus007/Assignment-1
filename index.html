        <p class="ptin">As we all know, in order to obtain something good and achieve a favourable outcome, we must get out of our comfort zone to do things. I'd say this is pretty a known, yet valuable piece of information. Thus going out of our own comfort zones can lead us to succeed in things which would otherwise be perceived as difficult, or even impossible!</p>

        <p class="pchar">One of the hardest parts on staying sturdy in a certain activity would be perseverance i.e. staying on track.The number of distractions that arise on a daily, even an hourly basis is mind-boggling. And so,we are left with no choice but to sacrifice alot of things. It could be hanging out with friends, social gatherings, leisure activities, and other things of the sort. A short sacrifice in these places will allow for a much brighter and fruitful future. </p>

        <p class="ftin">Traditionally speaking, people mostly consider being a Doctor or an Engineer as a career path. But I have something completely different in mind!. By this point I can safely say I have spent a considerable chunk of my life playing video games, and I'm sure it'll continue that way. So as an avid enjoyer of gaming, it would be like dreaming with one's eyes open to make a successful video game of my own!</p>
